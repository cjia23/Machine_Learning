Implemented 5 Neural Network Models, linear regression and SVM model with rbf kernels. Compared the different parameters for common neural network models, NO. of layers, NO. of neurons in hidden layer, activation function, optimizer(learning rate) and loss function.

2. Parkinson Diease Classification

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson%27s+Disease+Classification

Compared the significance of 6 individule feature groups, also using Recursive Feature selection method to select the top 100 features. Implemented Neural Network, SVM linear, SVM rbf, Random Forest, Logistic Regression as well as two ensemble models. Achieved a highest accuracy rate of 72%, 0.71 F1 score and 0.70 recall score.
